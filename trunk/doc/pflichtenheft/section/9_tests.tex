We'd like to address the reader of this documentation before going into the details of this documentation that the project itself encountered several challenges which couldn't all be solved in a satisfying way. These lead to a program with a limited functionality and a documentation with some major gaps. For reasons and the progress itself which lead to this situation please refer to chapter 8.
